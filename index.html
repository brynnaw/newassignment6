<p>Hi my name is Amanda Haney And I’m Erin Patterson And I’m Brynna Wainwright</p>
<p>And today we are going to talk to you all about Neural Networks within the context of Machine Learning. First we will give you an overview of what neural networks are and what they do. Then we will dive into the three paradigms in which neural networks learn. Then we will finish off with some real world applications of this technology in action and why it matters. &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>A neural network is a system of hardware or software that’s modeled after the human brain. It has a collection of neural units which are comparable to the biological neurons that are connected by axons and used by the human brain to solve problems.<br />
&lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt; #</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>The goal of neural networks is to be able to solve problems similar to how the human brain would. Algorithms and actual hardware construct the neural units to work similar to the biological neurons of the brain. The networks are usually organized in layers. Patterns are introduced as an “input”. They then are communicated with the “hidden layers.” This is where the actual processing takes place. The hidden layers produce an output layer which is the answer it gives.</p>
<p>Think of this as if a friend says hi to you. Their greeting is the input. The hidden layer is your brain processing someone greeting you, you realizing that you were greeting, and preparing your response. Your “output layer” is you smiling and saying hello back. &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>When teaching these machines and using neural networks, there are three methods of leanrning:</p>
<p>Supervised Learning In supervised learning we get a set of example pairs and the aim is for the neural networks to find a function that connects the examples (from a set of given functions).</p>
<p>Unsupervised Learning In unsupervised learning we’re given some data and the machine is given the task of inferring a function to connect the unlabeled data.</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning In reinforcement learning the data isn’t given to the machine but the machine has to discover the data through interactions with an environment. -Based off of conditioning psychology, such as “positive reinforcement”</p>
<p>We’ll be focusing on reinforcement learning! &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Reinforcement learning allows machines and software agents to determine the correct behaviour in a specific context through interaction with the environment. It’s goal is to maximize its performance. How it does that is that we have a machine or software acting as our agent that follows specific rules and regulations At each action step that the agent needs to take it will calculate all of the possible outcomes and rewards and choose the action that it thinks will best lead to a reward the machine or software agent learns the best behavior based on feedback from the environment &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Reinforcement learning is based in psychological conditioning, and uses a simple reward feedback known as the reinforcement signal. This causes the agent to “learn” it’s behavior. There are algorithms that employ this simple reward feedback with machines, and in fact Reinforcement Learning is defined as a specific type of problem and all of it’s solutions are classified as Reinforcement Learning algorithms. &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>When presented with a problem the agent (in these cases the machine) is tasked with deciding the best action based on the current state. When this step is repeated, the problem is known as a Markov Decision Process. &lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how google photos knows what your pictures are and how to search through them? Google’s software allows you to search for things like “ocean” or “dog” and returns your picture that match the criteria. This is made possible by the neural networks within image recognition technology.&lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>As a very simplified example, take this neural network that is trained to recognize the likelihood that a handwritten character is an “8”. While this seems like an easy task, just look at all of the different ways to write an 8.&lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>Then, through supervised learning and millions of image data, we can train the network to recognize 8’s and create the correct intermediate values by feeding it training data and telling it the probability of an 8 is 100%, not an 8 is 0% or vice versa.&lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>The “policy network”, predicts the next move, and is used to narrow the search to consider only the moves most likely to lead to a win. The other neural network, the “value network”, is then used to reduce the depth of the search tree -- estimating the winner in each position in place of searching all the way to the end of the game.&lt;/aside class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;</p>
